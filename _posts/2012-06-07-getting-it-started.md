Welcome to a new episode of my career.  
I've finally decided to create this new site and, most important, blog.  
As some of you might now, Last year I had a fantastic internship at Smashing Magazine. Over there I've learned plenty of stuff and with their new redesign which I collaborated putting in place,
my eyes have opened to the world of reading experience and typography.

This site is my latest and probably most successful attempt at promoting myself to the internets.
I've focused a lot on creating the most minimal yet comprehensive experience of navigating a site, using most of my knowledges gathered during years of webmaking experience.  
What you see is the result of my efforts.

Hope you enjoy it!
