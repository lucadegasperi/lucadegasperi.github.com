		<p>Frontend, backend, HTML5, Javascript, Obj-C, CSS3, Git, JSON, PHP, SQL, XML, PixelMator, Sublime Text, you name it! I work with lots of different technologies and softwares. Mix and match them for the best results, is my daily job.</p>
		
		<p>Don't panic, I don't spend all my days in front of a screen. Living in the middle of the alps is great for an outdoor lover like me. Wether it's trekking, rock climbing or snowboarding, Nature is my second home.</p>
